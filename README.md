# Airport.Database

Copyright Â© Jonathan Pearson

The contents of Airport.Database cannot be used without specific written permission.  

This project allows for a world database of airports to be updated quickly without manual input.
There are many exceptions included to account for all data input formats.  This is not the complete
project but the code contains most of the needed functionality and a working GUI.  This program will
parse over 50000 airports and format the data so it can be used by other programs and GPS systems.
